abstract: Dual-rail logic circuits are used as an effective countermeasure
  towards secure circuit design. However, with technology scaling, they lose
  interest in signal reduction. In this work, we demonstrate that in presence of
  intrinsic physical noise, dual-rail circuits leverage more noise compared to
  CMOS. Our analysis which extends to cryptographic Figures-of-Merit (FoMs) such
  as the Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) and the Mutual Information (MI) clarifies
  the potential of such circuits to concretely increase the noise.
