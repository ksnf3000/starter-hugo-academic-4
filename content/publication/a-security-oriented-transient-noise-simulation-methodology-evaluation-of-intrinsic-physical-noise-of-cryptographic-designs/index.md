abstract: Noise in digital circuits has always been minimized to achieve high
  signal integrity, robust operation and of course high performance. However,
  for cryptographic applications, increased noise can in fact be beneficial. It
  can be used effectively to reduce the (cryptographic) Signal-to-Noise (SNR)
  ratio and to make it harder for an adversary to extract useful information
  (e.g., secret keys) from the side channel leakage data. A natural question
  concerns the extent to which intrinsic (internal) noise is required to improve
  security. In this manuscript, we explore this question and further introduce a
  methodology to exploit the intrinsic physical noise (i.e., flicker- and
  thermal-noise) at the secure circuit level. We additionally demonstrate how
  the values obtained from our methodology translate into relevant cryptographic
  metrics. Our simulations show that the calculated cryptographic noise values
  are in close agreement with the noise levels extracted from noisy
  distributions using transient noise analysis. We finally evaluate (with the
  proposed methodology) several meaningful parameters which affect the internal
  noise (and their security extent) such as transistors-sizing and
  voltage-supply changes.
